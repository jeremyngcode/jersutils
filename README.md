jersutils - A Mini Package
==========================

Intro
-----
I've been writing various automation scripts ever since I picked up Python back in July 2023. Quite a bit of those involve retrieving data from various APIs and writing to Excel or Google Sheets. So at some point I decided to bundle these functions that I wrote into mini packages for better organization. That was when I first learnt about the special \_\_init\_\_.py file and gained a better understanding of Python packages.

jersutils is the first package I made. I intend to include all finance and crypto/web3 related functions that I write here.

#### Notable libraries I used / learned for this project:
